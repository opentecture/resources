## [Opentecture Bookmarks View-a-line R1]( https://opentecture.github.io/resources/sandbox/view-a-line-bookmarks.html )

* Opentecture Bookmarks in JSON Lines viewer and editor

## [Opentecture Bookmarks Add-a-line R1]( https://opentecture.github.io/resources/sandbox/add-a-line-bookmarks.html )

* Opentecture Bookmarks JSON Lines file creator

## Concept

This script is a side project of the <a href="https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#sandbox/gbxml-to-json-lines/" target="_blank">gbXML to JSON Lines </a> project. It is a work-in-progress continuation of manipulating JSON Lines files in useful ways.

## Problem to be solved

* Very long read me files with naked links are tedious and uninformative/uncurated
* Workflows for adding links to bookmarks in your browser then getting these links into markdown are complex
## Objectives

* Build a list [of resources] good enough for inclusion here: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
* Good ways of managing curated lists.
* Take a bunch of links from browser bookmark manager and get them into a markdown file quickly and easily
* View and manage links with a tree-view menu system
