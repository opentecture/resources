# [Sandbox Read Me]( index.html )


## [Opentecture Bookmarks View-a-line]( https://opentecture.github.io/resources/sandbox/view-a-line-bookmarks/index.html )

* Opentecture Bookmarks in JSON Lines viewer and editor

## [Opentecture Bookmarks Add-a-line]( https://opentecture.github.io/resources/sandbox/add-a-line-bookmarks/index.html )

* Opentecture Bookmarks file creator: open, parse and save your browser's bookmarks to a JSON lines file

## Concept

The scripts here are a side project of the <a href="https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#sandbox/gbxml-to-json-lines/" target="_blank">gbXML to JSON Lines </a> project. They are a work-in-progress continuation of manipulating JSON Lines files in useful ways.

The scripts here are also an attempt to explore ways of managing browser bookmarks in a simple and open-source manner.


## Problem to be solved

* Very long read me files with naked links are tedious and uninformative/uncurated
* Workflows for adding links to bookmarks in your browser then getting these links into markdown are complex

## Objectives

* Build a list [of resources] good enough for inclusion here: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
* Good ways of managing curated lists.
* Take a bunch of links from browser bookmark manager and get them into a markdown file quickly and easily
* View and manage links with a tree-view menu system
