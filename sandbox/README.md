## Problem to be solved

* Very long read me files with naked links are tedious and uninformative/uncurated
* Workflows for adding links to bookmarks in your browser then getting these links into markdown are complex
## Objectives

* Build a list [of resources] good enough for inclusion here: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
* Good ways of managing curated lists.
* Take a bunch of links from browser bookmark manager and get them into a markdown file quickly and easily
* View and manage links with a tree-view menu system
